				Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in São Pedro, Funchal, on the island of Madeira, Portugal, and grew up in Santo António, Funchal.[10][11] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro (b. 1954), a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro (1953–2005), a municipal gardener and a part-time kit man.[12] His second given name, "Ronaldo", was chosen after then-U.S. president Ronald Reagan.[13] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[14] He has one older brother, Hugo (b. 1975), and two older sisters, Elma (b. 1973) and Liliana Cátia "Katia" (b. 1977), who is a singer.[2] Ronaldo grew up in a Catholic and impoverished home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[15]
                As a child, Ronaldo played for amateur team Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[16] where his father was the kit man,[17] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[18][19] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's other youth players at the club's football academy.[18] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally, and agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football.[20] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[20] However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[21] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[22] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[23][24]At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[25] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team, and the first team, all within a single season.[18] A year later, on 7 October 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Moreirense, and scored two goals in their 3–0 win.[26] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[27] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing the winger, met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.[28]Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season.[32] His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[33] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[34][35] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[35] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager, Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said, "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."[36]
